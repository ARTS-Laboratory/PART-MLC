# FFT-based Time Series Forecasting
## Python Function
## FFT_V1
## How to run:
There are two script of python
1. main.py:  This is for user. Data input and tuning the configuration and plot the output by this one.
2. partMLC.py:  This is the whole FFT based prediction function.
    This script has three functions inside:
    
    (a) fft_prediction:  FFT based prediction model works
    
    (b) plotting_all:  This function is for plotting output of the model
    
    (c) range_with_floats:This function increments the start number by step until it reaches stop.

3. For user just need to run the main.py
4. data folder has data what is used.
5. plots folder save output plots.

## FFT_V2
## How to run:
There are two script of python
1. run_partMLC.py:  This is for user. Data input and tuning the configuration and plot the output by this one (reduce configuration options, more user friendly compare to FFT_V1).
2. partMLC.py:  This is the whole FFT based prediction function.
    This script has two functions inside:
    
    (a)fft_prediction:  FFT based prediction model works
    (b) range_with_floats:This function increments the start number by step until it reaches stop.
