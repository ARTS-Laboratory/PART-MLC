# FFT-based Time Series Forecasting
## Python Function
## FFT_Function
## How to run:
There are two script of python
1. run_partMLC.py:  This is for user. Data input and tuning the configuration 
2. partMLC.py:  This is the whole FFT based prediction function.
    This script has two functions inside:
    
    (a)fft_prediction:  FFT based prediction model works
    
    (b) range_with_floats:This function increments the start number by step until it reaches stop.

3. For user just need to run_partMLC.py
4. data folder has data what is used.
