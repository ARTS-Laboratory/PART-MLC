# FFT-based Time Series Forecasting
## Python Function
## How to run:
There are two script of python
1. main.py:  This is for user. Data input and tuning the configuration and plot the output by this one.
2. model.py:  This is the whole FFT based prediction function.
    This script has three functions inside:
    
    (a) fft_prediction:  FFT based prediction model works
    
    (b) plotting_all:  This function is for plotting output of the model
    
    (c) range_with_floats:This function increments the start number by step until it reaches stop.

3. For user just need to run the main.py
