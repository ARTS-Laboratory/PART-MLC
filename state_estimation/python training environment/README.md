## Python training environment for Real Time-deployable LSTMs.
Everything should be here so that you train models immediately after downloading the repo. Run the most recent `train_lstm.py`, (right now `_v13.py`). To get .csv files compatible with the LabVIEW LSTM library, use `save_model_weight_as_csv` in `load and save model.py`. Note the dependencies:

Tensorflow 2.5.0\
Numpy 1.19.5\
onnxruntime 1.11.0
