# MLP sizing

This code is used for getting latency constraints for various MLP sizes. These are built off of [ARTS-Laboratory/attention_layer_algorithm/MLP/MLP_on_9054/v_2.1/].

## v1.1
Generic code used to get latency numbers for MLP algorithms of [50,X,1].

## v1.2
Generic code used to get latency numbers for MLP algorithms of [50,X,X,1].
