run 'analyzing_result_figure_5_6_learning_error.py'
## plots 2:
plot Effect of various learning window lengths (L) showing:
(a) MAE in different states, and; (b) transient time.
run'analyzing_result_figure_7_various_learning_lengths.py'
## plots 3:
Effect of various computational time (T) in a specific
learning window length (L) showing: (a) MAE in different states, and;
(b) transient time.
